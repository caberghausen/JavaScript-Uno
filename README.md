# JavaScript Uno

Web-based Uno game built in collaboration with a partner for *CSE 330: Rapid Prototype Development and Creative Programming* and played on a single computer. Utilized a similar process from a previous project in the class to enable users to "log on" with AJAX post data, PHP, and SQL, hashing usernames & passwords and storing them in a database. Once logged on, up to 8 players could be visually added around the table. We used JavaScript for all the functionality of the game, manipulating the DOM and HTML elements' styling and using functions & event listeners to apply the rules.

If board doesn't appear, click 'Sign Up.' 2-8 players can be added by clicking 'Add Player,' and game starts after clicking 'Start.' Cards are dealt and drawn pseudo-randomly and play goes clockwise by clicking on the card in each player's hand to be played. If no card can be played, you must click on the deck (the card that says Uno) to draw another card. Play continues until a player gets rid of all of their cards.

All rules of the classic Uno card game are followed (except there is no penalty for forgetting to say "Uno!" when you have 1 card remaining!).
