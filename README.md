Web-based Uno game built in collaboration with a partner for Rapid Prototype Development and Creative Programming CSE 330 and played on a single computer. Utilized a similar process from a previous project in the class to enable users to "log on" with AJAX post data, PHP, and SQL, hashing usernames & passwords and storing them in a database. Once logged on, up to 8 players could be visually added around the table. We used JavaScript for all the functionality of the game, manipulating the DOM and HTML elements' styling and using functions & event listeners to apply the rules.
